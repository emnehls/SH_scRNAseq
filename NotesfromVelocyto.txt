# Notes from getting Velocyto to run on KO_Naive samples

On my home desktop, velocyto was having a hard time allocating memory.
I ended up sorting using samtools manually. 

## samtools

Here is the samtools sort command:
samtools sort -m 2000M -t CB -O BAM -@ 10 -o KO_results/results/outs/cellsorted_possorted_genome_bam.bam KO_results/results/outs/possorted_genome_bam.bam

-The -m option is to specify memory *per thread*
-The -@ option is to specify the number of threads
-I ran this command from the velocyto folder in the scRNAseq folder or root folder of the repo

## velocyto

Commmand:
velocyto run10x -m mm10_rmsk.gtf KO_results/results refdata-gex-mm10-2020-A/genes/genes.gtf

-ran this in velocyto folder inside root scRNAseq folder
-velocyto is installed via python in a virtual environment,
so first virtual environment must be actsource env/bin/activate
