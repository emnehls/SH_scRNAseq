# SH_scRNAseq

This is a github repo for collaboration on Skyler's single cell RNAseq data analysis with Bhlhe40 KO and WT mice!
In an attempt to clean this up and avoid merge conflicts, I am adding the files that are generated by knitting the R markdown 
to a document that tells github to ignore them.
This should save us headaches in the future. 
The only downside is that you will have to re-run the code to generate the figures or html report when the code changes. 
I am also adding the data itself to this gitignore file. 

### Quick and dirty github workflow

* Open this project in R-studio on your computer
* Pull any updates from the repo
* Code 
* Commit your changes to git with a nice descriptive commit message
* Pull any updates from the repo that happened while you were coding
* Push your changes to the repo

This website is an incredibly good resource: https://happygitwithr.com/

### TODO

Here we can keep a running todo list of priorities for data analysis

* Tabulate cell count for each cluster
* Perform trajectory analysis on Naive datasets
* Perform all analyses on HKTB datasets
