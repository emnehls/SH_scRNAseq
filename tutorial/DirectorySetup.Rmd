# Directory set-up to replicate current script

Hi, Skyler. In order to run/knit the current R markdown script you should
just need to replicate the important folders of the directory as seen here. 

![A screenshot of my whole directory](/media/StallingsLab/scRNAseq/tutorial/directory.png)

1. Specifically, you need to make a folder titled "files" in the same folder as you R project.
1. Then you need to make two folders inside the files folder titled "csv_xlsx_files"
and "markers_rds".
1. Then you can just download the "WT_Naive" and "KO_Naive" folders as they are in box into the same folder as your R project.
1. Finally, just download the .Rmd markdown file to the same folder. 
1. **Now you should be able to press the knit button and generate the full report!**

This will populate many of the folders that you made early and generate a folder for
the "SH_scRNAseq_files", all of the plots generated by the markdown document.
The first time you run it, it will probably take 15 or 20 minutes. 
After that, it should run much faster, because it will utilize the 
pre-saved files in "markers_rds" to generate the expression tables.
